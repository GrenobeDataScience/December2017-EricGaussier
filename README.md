# December 2017: Eric Gaussier
On December 6th, 2017 Eric Gaussier gave a meet-up presentation entitled *"27 Years of Text Mining:
A Personal View on the Evolution of NLP, IR and ML over the last decades"*. 

The repository contains the slides of the talk ("27YearsOfTextMining.pdf"). 
For reference, the abstract and the a short bio of Eric, below. 


## Talk Abstract

In this presentation, we will review some of the major evolutions (as the evolution from symbolic to statistical approaches and from statistical to deep learning methods) of three related fields that form the basis for text mining: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML). We will try to exhibit the elements that were key in these evolutions as well as their respective role.

## Short Speaker Bio

Eric Gaussier's research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) and focuses on models and alogrithms to extract information, insights and knowledge from data in various forms. Eric Gaussier has worked on three main subfields of AI and DS: machine learning, information retrieval and computational linguistics, in both industry (Centre Scientifique d’IBM France, Xerox Research Center Europe) and academia (Univ. Grenoble Alpes). He is currently Director of LIG (Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble) and Professor of Computer Science at Univ. Grenoble Alpes.
